MathLibrary.dll Documentation:

MathLibrary.dll is a .NET DLL library that provides basic math operations for applications that require math calculations. It offers the following functionalities:

1. Addition:
   - Method: Add(a, b)
   - Description: Performs the addition of two numbers.
   - Parameters:
     - `a` (double): The first number to add.
     - `b` (double): The second number to add.
   - Returns:
     - (double): The sum of `a` and `b`.

2. Subtraction:
   - Method: Subtract(a, b)
   - Description: Performs the subtraction of two numbers.
   - Parameters:
     - `a` (double): The number to subtract from.
     - `b` (double): The number to subtract.
   - Returns:
     - (double): The difference between `a` and `b`.

3. Multiplication:
   - Method: Multiply(a, b)
   - Description: Performs the multiplication of two numbers.
   - Parameters:
     - `a` (double): The first number to multiply.
     - `b` (double): The second number to multiply.
   - Returns:
     - (double): The product of `a` and `b`.

4. Division:
   - Method: Divide(a, b)
   - Description: Performs the division of two numbers.
   - Parameters:
     - `a` (double): The number to be divided.
     - `b` (double): The divisor.
   - Returns:
     - (double): The quotient of `a` divided by `b`.

5. Exponent:
   - Method: Power(baseNumber, exponent)
   - Description: Calculates the result of raising a number to a specified exponent.
   - Parameters:
     - `baseNumber` (double): The base number.
     - `exponent` (double): The exponent to raise the base number to.
   - Returns:
     - (double): The result of `baseNumber` raised to the power of `exponent`.

6. Modulo (%):
   - Method: Modulo(a, b)
   - Description: Calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another (modulo operation).
   - Parameters:
     - `a` (double): The number to be divided.
     - `b` (double): The divisor.
   - Returns:
     - (double): The remainder after dividing `a` by `b`.

7. Average:
   - Method: Average(numbers)
   - Description: Calculates the average of a sequence of numbers.
   - Parameters:
     - `numbers` (double[]): An array of numbers.
   - Returns:
     - (double): The average of the numbers in the array.

Usage Example:

```csharp
using MathLibrary;
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        double a = 5.0;
        double b = 3.0;

        double sum = MathOperations.Add(a, b);
        double difference = MathOperations.Subtract(a, b);
        double product = MathOperations.Multiply(a, b);
        double quotient = MathOperations.Divide(a, b);
        double powerResult = MathOperations.Power(a, b);
        double remainder = MathOperations.Modulo(a, b);
        double[] numbers = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 };
        double average = MathOperations.Average(numbers);

        Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
        Console.WriteLine("Difference: " + difference);
        Console.WriteLine("Product: " + product);
        Console.WriteLine("Quotient: " + quotient);
        Console.WriteLine("Power Result: " + powerResult);
        Console.WriteLine("Remainder: " + remainder);
        Console.WriteLine("Average: " + average);

        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```
